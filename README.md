Pi# (pronounced “Pi Sharp”) is a library to expose the GPIO functionality of the Raspberry Pi computer to the C# and Visual Basic.Net languages.

Also included is the Pi# simulator which runs under Windows, OSX or Linux to allow you to develop and test GPIO based programs without a Raspberry Pi. For information on using Pi# see Setting Up Pi Sharp
